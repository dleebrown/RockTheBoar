# RockTheBoar
Code written as part of the Kaggle Carvana Image Masking Challenge. Our final submission (in /tensorflow_gan) used a 12 layer autoencoder-style fully convolutional neural network - 6 convolutional layers followed by 6 deconvolutional layers. See convnet_architecture_12l.py for details.

# RockTheBoar
Code written as part of the Kaggle Carvana Image Masking Challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge). The overal goal of this competition was to design an algorithm to accurately mask cars in images. Our final submission (in /tensorflow_gan) used a 12 layer autoencoder-style fully convolutional neural network - 6 convolutional layers followed by 6 deconvolutional layers. See convnet_architecture_12l.py for details.

# RockTheBoar

rtb_train.py is based on simple implementations shown in kaggle examples.

Things different are: 

1. cnn model can now be changed via simple_model.py

2. io_functions.py is for loading data, saving model etc. 

3. Training images folder, and csv files must be unzipped outside RockTheBoar directory.

4. Currently working on the separate testing script: rtb_test.py
